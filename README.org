* Introduction

Provides rcirc activity tracking and server filtering for ibuffer.

* Usage

To group buffers by IRC server:

  ~M-x ibuffer-rcirc-set-filter-groups-by-server~

To sort them by activity status (nick/keyword mentions, unread messages):

  ~M-x ibuffer-do-sort-by-rcirc-activity-status~

To filter by server:

  ~M-x ibuffer-filter-by-rcirc-server~

If you'd like to see activity status as a ~ibuffer~ column, include
~rcirc-activity-status~ or ~rcirc-activity-status-mini~ in
~ibuffer-formats~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq ibuffer-formats
      '((mark modified read-only vc-status-mini " "
              (name 18 18 :left :elide)
              " "
              (size 9 -1 :right)
              " "
              (mode 16 16 :left :elide)
              " "
              ;; (rcirc-activity-status 20 18 :left)
              (rcirc-activity-status-mini 5 3 :center)
              " "
              filename-and-process)))
#+END_SRC

Finally, If you want to combine the server filter groups with your
own, you can use ~ibuffer-rcirc-generate-filter-groups-by-server~.
